# JP-Morgan-Chase-Dataset---End-to-End-Project
This dataset includes a record for every branch of Chase Bank in the United States,  including the branch's name and number, date established as a bank office and (if applicable)  acquired by JP Morgan Chase, physical location as street address, city, state, zip, and latitude  and longitude coordinates, and the amount deposited at the branch (or the institution, for the  bank's main office) between July 1 and June 30, 2016, in US dollars.
      
                 
                  This Project takes in the last six years annual deposits of a branch alongwith their established and acquired ages
                        and on the basis of it, it predicts the seventh year's annual deposit 
                  Implemented RandomForest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor
                  Also used RandomSearchCV, GridSearchCV and Genetic Algorithm for hyper-parameter tuning
                  Deployed the model using Flask
